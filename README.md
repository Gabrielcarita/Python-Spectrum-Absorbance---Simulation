# Python-Spectrum-Absorbance---Simulation

This script has the function of simulating an absorption spectrum based on data obtained through QM software by DFT and TDDFT methods.
Must enter data table (absorption / frequency swept) - test1.csv - test2.csv ...
And with the frequencies of the transitions (forcaosc.csv, forcaosc2.csv ...), starting from a principle of overlapping of waves of OHTA
